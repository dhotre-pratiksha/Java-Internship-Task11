TASK 11 : File Handling – User Data Storage System

Java Internship Task 11 – File Handling : User Data Storage System

This project demonstrates :
- File creation and handling in Java
- Writing user data using FileWriter and BufferedWriter
- Reading data using FileReader and BufferedReader
- Appending data instead of overwriting
- Exception handling for IO operations
- Proper resource management using try-with-resources

This task helped me understand persistent data storage in Java.
